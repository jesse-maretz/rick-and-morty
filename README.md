# Rick and Morty

Currently a work-in-progress

## Overview
A React.js application that demonstrates full CRUD functionality by consuming a 3rd-party [Rick & Morty API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/documentation/).

## Setup
This app utilizes [_axios_](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) -- with more packages to be implemented soon -- minor setup is required.
- Fork & clone this repository to your local device
- Navigate to the *root* of the repo
- Run `npm i` in the terminal to install _axios_ & other packages
- Still in the *root*, run `npm start` to open the application
- You're all set!
